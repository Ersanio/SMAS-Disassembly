This is a project where I disassemble and document Super Mario All-Stars.

Certain banks are currently missing. Those banks are graphics and will be added in the final step.

There are plans to make this disassembly assemble-able in either xkas or asar. This will happen once the disassembly is considered complete.

Game codes are located in the following banks:
$008000-$02FFFF: Presents screen, hall screen, game select screen
$038000-$0CFFFF: Super Mario Bros. 1
$0D8000-$10FFFF: Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels
$118000-$15FFFF: Super Mario Bros. 2
$208000-$2AFFFF: Super Mario Bros. 3

Note to self:

Regex for finding ROM access: (AND|LD[AXY]|ORA|ADC|SBC|EOR|TSB|TRB|JSR|JMP) \$([8-F][0-9A-F]{3})
